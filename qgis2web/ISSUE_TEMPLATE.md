Before opening an issue:
- Check that you have installed the latest version of qgis2web
- Search among the issues if a similar report already exists and if you can find your solution
- Simplify your project with simple layer names, simple field names, simple symbols (Avoid apostrophe, double quotes, parentheses, accents..)
- Attach an example of your project so that we can reproduce the issue
- If you can't attach an example project, attach screenshots

For the experts:
- Paste qgis2web or QGIS Python console errors
- Paste browser console errors
